# Project Summary: Montgomery Fleet Equipment Inventory Data enhancement

## Objective
This project involved converting a CSV file named `Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory.csv` to an Excel file, resulting in `Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory.xlsx`.

## Tasks Performed

1. **Column Width Adjustment:**
   - Sorted the width of all columns to ensure data is clearly visible in all cells.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed all empty rows.
   - Identified and removed any duplicate data.
   - Checked and corrected spelling mistakes.
   - Found and replaced all double white spaces and trimmed leading or trailing spaces in cells.

3. **Column Merging:**
   - Merged two columns named "Departments" that were split during import.

4. **Data Formatting and Analysis:**
   - Formatted the data as a table.
   - Calculated the sum, average, minimum, maximum, and count for the column "Equipment Count".

5. **Pivot Table Creation:**
   - Created a pivot table displaying the "Department" field and "Equipment Count".
   - Created two additional pivot tables similar to the first one, with the addition of the "Vehicle Type" field along with the "Department" field.

## Outcome
The resulting Excel file, `Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory.xlsx`, is well-organized with clear visibility of data in all cells. Empty rows and duplicate data were removed, and all spelling and formatting issues were corrected. The data is formatted as a table, and statistical functions (sum, average, minimum, maximum, count) were calculated for the "Equipment Count" column. Additionally, three pivot tables were created to provide insightful data summaries, enhancing the overall data analysis and usability for fleet management.
