# Project README: Tech Fest Data Organization

## Objective
This project involved collaborating with the organizers of a tech fest to enhance their understanding of participant data. The organizers collected data via Google Forms and provided it to me for cleaning and structuring.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Data Extraction and Conversion:**
   - Extracted data from the CSV file named `solve_for_planet.csv`.
   - Converted the extracted CSV file to an Excel (`.xlsx`) file using Microsoft Excel.

2. **Data Cleaning and Arrangement:**
   - **Team Member Organization:** Arranged all team members of a group together in one place.
   - **Team Sorting:** Sorted teams based on the number of members, in the following order:
     - Teams with 4 members
     - Teams with 3 members
     - Teams with 2 members
     - Solo participants
   - **Formatting:** Added a gap between each team for better readability.
   - **Highlighting:** Highlighted a merged cell named "Team Members" with the number of players in the team (e.g., "4 Member Team") in light orange color for easy identification.

3. **Data Privacy:**
   - Removed columns containing private details of participants, such as phone numbers, names, and email addresses, to ensure privacy before uploading the data.

## Outcome
The resulting Excel file, `solve for planet.xlsx`, is well-organized, with teams clearly categorized by size and visually separated for ease of analysis. Private participant information has been securely removed to protect privacy.
